This repository hosts the **ConPass Ontology** – a shared, construction-specific Digital Product Passport (DPP) ontology.  

📄 **About ConPass**  
This ontology is designed to provide a standardized data structure encompassing essential DPP information, including:  
- 🏷 **Product identification**  
- 📊 **General attributes**  
- 🌱 **Sustainability-related data**  

By formalizing and connecting these elements, ConPass supports interoperability, data reuse, and lifecycle transparency for construction products.
